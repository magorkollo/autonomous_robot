Autonomous robots, computer vision and AI controlled applications are getting higher influence
in our everyday life. Similarly, in the case of precision agriculture is the same, where the help
of these robots could conduct a more efficient but also greener way of food production. 

The main goal of this project is to develop a robotic platform which is capable of carrying out
agricultural activities, by integrating technological advances from the last years. The project
is based on a mobile robotic platform equipped with a robotic arm and a depth camera, connected
to an embedded computer. ROS is used to control the robot and AI algorithms are used to provide
autonomy. 

This project was my Bachelor's License (BSc) project in Computer Science & Automation at the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca, and I managed to won the

## Background

Standard Readme started with the issue originally posed by [@maxogden](https://github.com/maxogden) over at [feross/standard](https://github.com/feross/standard) in [this issue](https://github.com/feross/standard/issues/141), about whether or not a tool to standardize readmes would be useful. A lot of that discussion ended up in [zcei's standard-readme](https://github.com/zcei/standard-readme/issues/1) repository. While working on maintaining the [IPFS](https://github.com/ipfs) repositories, I needed a way to standardize Readmes across that organization. This specification started as a result of that.

> Your documentation is complete when someone can use your module without ever
having to look at its code. This is very important. This makes it possible for
you to separate your module's documented interface from its internal
implementation (guts). This is good because it means that you are free to
change the module's internals as long as the interface remains the same.

> Remember: the documentation, not the code, defines what a module does.

~ [Ken Williams, Perl Hackers](http://mathforum.org/ken/perl_modules.html#document)

Writing READMEs is way too hard, and keeping them maintained is difficult. By offloading this process - making writing easier, making editing easier, making it clear whether or not an edit is up to spec or not - you can spend less time worrying about whether or not your initial documentation is good, and spend more time writing and using code.

By having a standard, users can spend less time searching for the information they want. They can also build tools to gather search terms from descriptions, to automatically run example code, to check licensing, and so on.

The goals for this repository are:

1. A well defined **specification**. This can be found in the [Spec document](spec.md). It is a constant work in progress; please open issues to discuss changes.
2. **An example README**. This Readme is fully standard-readme compliant, and there are more examples in the `example-readmes` folder.
3. A **linter** that can be used to look at errors in a given Readme. Please refer to the [tracking issue](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme/issues/5).
4. A **generator** that can be used to quickly scaffold out new READMEs. See [generator-standard-readme](https://github.com/RichardLitt/generator-standard-readme).
5. A **compliant badge** for users. See [the badge](#badge).

## Prerequisites

The project is based on the [Robot Operaing System's](https://www.ros.org/)  [Melodic Distro](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic). One should start with the installation steps provided by the ROS platform. The recommended OS is [Ubuntu 18.04](https://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/) for the Master PC and [JetPack 4.6] for the Jetson Nano since it has been tested only in this configuration, but it should be working fine on other Linux-based systems too.

On the Hardware side, I was working with a [Jetson Nano Dev Kit](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-nano-developer-kit) used for controlling the robotic platform, which is a [Turtlebot3 Waffle](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/overview/) completed by the [OpenManipulator-X](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/openmanipulator_x/overview/) robotic arm. In addition, I use an [Intel Realsense D435i Depth Camera](https://www.intelrealsense.com/depth-camera-d435i/) for customized object detection and getting the object's coordinates in 3D space.




## Install

### D435i Depth Camera

For using the camera one should install the realsense2 SDK's [ROS wrapper](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/realsense-ros) by typing:

```sh
$ sudo apt-get install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-realsense2-camera
```

Unfortunately, in case of the ARM arhictectures it does not work, so one has to build both the ROS package from source:

```sh
THIS PART HAS TO BE UPDATED...
```

Moreover, the [Python wrapper](https://pypi.org/project/pyrealsense2/) for the Intel RealSense SDK2.0 is also needed, which provides C++ to Python binding (maybe at some point I am going to use C++ instead of Python)

```sh
$ pip install pyrealsense2
```

In case of the SDK's Python wrapper the situation is the same (if it has not been resolved in the meantime) it does not work with the ARM processors, therefore we need to build it from source:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense.git
$ cd librealsense
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ../ -DBUILD_PYTHON_BINDINGS:bool=true -DBUILD_WITH_CUDA:bool=true
$ make -j4
$ sudo make install
```
After building the Python wrapeer for the Realsense SDK2.0 from source we need to update the ... 
```sh
$ cd ~/librealsense
$ ./scripts/setup_udev_rules.sh
```

Next, we need to add the following lines to .bashrc file:

```sh
sudo nano ~/.bashrc
export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/usr/local/lib
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/usr/local/lib/python3.6/pyrealsense2
```

### ROS Master-Slave with Jetson Nano

In case of the Turtlebot the most common method to control your robot is to use a master-slave configuration. The ROS Master helps individual nodes to communicate with each other peer-to-peer, therefore it is also used for the communication of multiple robots. In case of the Jetson Nano, it does not have RTC backup power supply the clock will be reseted after powering off. If it does not have an ethernet/internet connection it won't know the current date and time, but in many cases even having the internet connection it just simply did not synchronize with current time. On the other hand, the remote PC and the Jetson have to be synchronized somehow, otherwise there could be problems in the communication (at least in case of the OpenManipulator controller). There could be multiple solutions, like [this](https://github.com/justsoft/jetson-nano-date-sync) but I have used [chrony](https://chrony.tuxfamily.org/)

On our **remote PC**:

```sh
sudo apt-get install chrony
sudo nano /etc/chrony/chrony.conf
```

At the end of your chrony.conf file put the following, be aware of using the correct IP:
```sh
# make it serve time even if it is not synced (as it can't reach out)
local stratum 8
# allow the IP of your peer to connect
allow <IP of your time-clinet>
```

On our **Jetson Nano** the steps are similar:
```sh
sudo apt-get install chrony
sudo nano /etc/chrony/chrony.conf
```
Then we have to add the following line:
```sh
server <server_ip> minpoll 0 maxpoll 5 maxdelay .05
```

And it should work in the following. Source: I found this provided by lorenznew [here](https://answers.ros.org/question/298821/tf-timeout-with-multiple-machines/?answer=298908#post-id-298908)

## Usage

There are going to be shown multiple use-cases here, in which the arm could be used. Now, just a short description about how to launch the robot and use together with the arm. 

First on our **Remote PC** we should start running the roscore

```sh
roscore
```

Next in a new terminal window, we should connect to our **Jetson Nano, to bring up the Waffle** using:

```sh
ssh name_of_jetson@wlan_ip_of_jetson
roslaunch turtlebot3_bringup turtlebot3_robot.launch
```

For instance, for controlling the robotic arm, in the next phase we should make a connection **(bringup) the arm on our Remote PC**, by running the following command in a new terminal window:

```sh
roslaunch turtlebot3_manipulation_bringup turtlebot3_manipulation_bringup.launch
``` 
Note: here I've made some changes to be able to control the arm using ROS Melodic.

In the following step, I am using [MoveIt!](http://docs.ros.org/en/melodic/api/moveit_tutorials/html/index.html) to control the arm. For this, you can get ..., and we can launch the rviz and controller using:

```sh
roslaunch open_manipulator_controllers joint_trajectory_controller.launch sim:=false
```

### Generator

To use the generator, look at [generator-standard-readme](https://github.com/RichardLitt/generator-standard-readme). There is a global executable to run the generator in that package, aliased as `standard-readme`.

## Badge

If your README is compliant with Standard-Readme and you're on GitHub, it would be great if you could add the badge. This allows people to link back to this Spec, and helps adoption of the README. The badge is **not required**.
